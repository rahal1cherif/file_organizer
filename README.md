The File Organizer script automatically categorizes and moves files into folders based on their file extension. It supports a wide range of file types including images, documents, audio, video, archives, scripts, and more. This tool is designed to help you declutter your download or any specified folder by organizing files into clearly labeled folders.


1. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/rahal1cherif/file_organizer
cd file_organizer
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. There are no external dependencies required to run this script as it only uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

To use the File Organizer, navigate to the script's directory and run:
bash
python organizer.py
By default, the script organizes files in its current directory. If packaged into an executable, it will organize files in the directory where the executable is located.

## Customization

You can modify the `extension_to_file_format` dictionary to add or change how file types are categorized.
